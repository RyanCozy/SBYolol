### Guide
- Mining Lasers to :ML  
- Turret Bases to :RT(Right base) :LT(Left base) **Default state is upside down laser mount, If rightside up then switch RT and LT*
- RangeFinderOnState to :Mine and Distance to :R
- Button set to :Mine
- :RT=90/:R ; 90 was calculated by (Distance From RangeFinder to Turret x 45) In this case there was 2 meters between turret and rangefinder, 2x45=90) Change accordingly for yours, some minor adjustments may be necessary.
- FYI: The games beams are in CM not Meters, so make sure to convert for the equation above.
- :ML=20*:Mine... 20 is the RangerFinder Length Distance, Change to match yours. DONT MAKE THIS NUMBER TO BIG.
